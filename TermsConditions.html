                    been advised of the
                    possibility of such damages, and even if the remedy fails of its fundamental purpose.</p>
                <p>Some of the restrictions stated above may not be applicable to You as some states do not exclude
                    implied warranties or
                    the limitation of responsibility for incidental or consequential damages. Each party's liability
                    shall be restricted to
                    the maximum extent permissible by law in these states.</p>

                    licensors and service
                    providers. Without limiting the preceding, Bond Invstr disclaims all warranties or representation
                    that the Service will

                    Disputes
                </h5>

                    European Union consumer.</p>
                <h5>U.S. Legal Compliance</h5>
                <p>You warrant and declare that
                    - You are not in a nation that is subject to a U.S. government embargo or has been classified as a
                    "terrorist
                    supporting" country by the U.S. government.
                    - You are not on any list of forbidden or restricted parties maintained by the United States

                <h5>Severability</h5>
                <p>Suppose any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid. In that case, it will
                    be modified and
                    construed to achieve the provision's goals to the maximum degree feasible under applicable law. In
                    contrast, the

                <h5>Waiver</h5>
                <p>Except as otherwise provided herein, a party's failure to exercise a right or to require performance
                    of an obligation
                    under these Terms will not affect that party's ability to exercise that right or to require
                    performance at any time in
                    the future, nor will a waiver of one breach constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach.</p>
                <h5>Translation Interpretation</h5>
                <p>If We have made these Terms and Conditions available to You via our Service, they may have been
                    translated. In the event
                    of a disagreement, you agree that the original English text will take precedence.</p>
                <h5>Changes to These Terms and Conditions</h5>
                <p>We retain the right to change or alter these Terms at any time at our sole discretion. If the change
                    is significant, we
                    will try to provide you at least 30 days' notice before the new terms take effect. We shall decide
                    what constitutes a
                    substantial change at our sole discretion.</p>
                <p>You agree to be bound by the amended terms if you continue to access or use Our Service after the
                    modifications take
                    effect. Please cease using the website and the Service if you do not agree to the revised terms, in
